### Date: 2026-02-02

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Analyzed 30 observations, 10 events, and 14 impact links
- Identified 3 key insights about Ethiopia's financial inclusion landscape
- Created 7 visualizations to support analysis

## KEY FINDINGS
3 major insights were identified:

1. **Account Ownership Growth Has Significantly Slowed**
   - *Evidence*: Growth from 2021-2024: -39.5pp vs historical average: 6.8pp

3. **Significant Data Gaps Limit Analysis**
   - *Evidence*: 17 indicators have fewer than 3 data points
   - *Implication*: Limited ability to analyze trends and correlations
   - *Recommendation*: Prioritize data collection for key sparse indicators


## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
The analysis identified the following limitations:
1. Limited temporal coverage: only 6 years of data
2. 17 indicators have fewer than 3 data points
3. Limited demographic disaggregation (gender, location, income)

## NEXT STEPS FOR FORECASTING
1. **Event Impact Modeling**: Use impact links to quantify event effects
2. **Forecast Generation**: Project account ownership and digital payment rates
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Create optimistic, baseline, and pessimistic scenarios
4. **Dashboard Development**: Create interactive visualization tool
