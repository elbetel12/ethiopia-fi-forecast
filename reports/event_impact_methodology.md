# EVENT IMPACT MODELING METHODOLOGY
## Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasting
### Date: 2026-02-04

## 1. DATA SOURCES
- Event catalog: 1 events with dates and categories
- Impact links: 23 modeled relationships
- Historical data: Account ownership 2014-2024
- Comparable evidence: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania case studies

## 2. MODELING FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Impact Representation
- Magnitude: Proportional change (0-1 scale)
- Direction: Increase/decrease effects
- Lag: Time before impact realization (months)
- Evidence: Basis for each estimate

### 2.2 Event-Indicator Matrix
- Dimensions: 0 events × 0 indicators
- Non-zero entries: 0.0 impact relationships
- Average impact magnitude: N/A

### 2.3 Simulation Approach
1. Start with baseline values
2. Apply event impacts considering time lags
3. Include impact build-up periods
4. Sum effects of multiple events
5. Generate time series projections

## 3. VALIDATION RESULTS

### 3.1 Historical Validation
- Comparison periods: 6 years
- Mean Absolute Error: 17.00 percentage points
- Root Mean Square Error: 20.48 percentage points

### 3.2 Comparable Evidence Alignment
- 0 refinements applied
- Based on evidence from 2 countries

## 4. UNCERTAINTIES AND LIMITATIONS

### 4.1 Key Uncertainties
- **Impact magnitude estimates**: Medium uncertainty - Based on limited historical validation
- **Time lag accuracy**: High uncertainty - Limited data on actual realization periods
- **Event interaction effects**: High uncertainty - Unknown synergies or conflicts
- **External factors**: High uncertainty - Economic conditions, policy changes
- **Data quality**: Medium uncertainty - Mix of survey data and estimates
- **Model structure**: Low uncertainty - Simplified linear relationships


### 4.2 Limitations
1. Limited historical data for validation
2. Simplified impact accumulation model
3. Assumption of event independence
4. External factors not fully captured

## 5. NEXT STEPS FOR FORECASTING

### 5.1 Model Improvements
1. Incorporate non-linear impact relationships
2. Add interaction effects between events
3. Include economic context variables
4. Develop confidence intervals for estimates

### 5.2 Data Enhancements
1. Collect more frequent time series data
2. Gather additional comparable country evidence
3. Conduct expert validation of impact estimates
4. Track actual realization of event impacts

## 6. FILES GENERATED
1. Event-Indicator Association Matrix
2. Refined impact estimates
3. Model validation results
4. Impact timeline visualizations
